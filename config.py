     NOTES ON AGE APPROPRIATENESS:

- Children aged 1â€“5:
  Prefer simple stories, bright visuals, and funny, cartoonish characters.
  They should easily recognize shapes, animals, and expressive facial features.

- Children aged 5â€“10:
  Still love color and fun characters, but can handle a bit more plot complexity.
  Stories can involve friendship, teamwork, and light conflict resolution â€” still staying safe and optimistic.
  Think of familiar icons like Dora the Explorer, Bluey, or Doremon.

ðŸ‘¶ This config helps ensure that the entire system â€” from prompts to images â€” 
produces stories that are enjoyable, safe, and developmentally appropriate.
